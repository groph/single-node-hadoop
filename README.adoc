== Hadoop

This image is done by following the instructions from the following site:

https://hadoop.apache.org/docs/stable/hadoop-project-dist/hadoop-common/SingleCluster.html

The particular setup used is "Pseudo-Distributed Operation" on the previously mentioned webpage.

=== Configuration

==== Quick example

[source,bash]
----
docker run -d \
	-p 9000:9000 \
	-p 8088:8088 \
	-p 9870:9870 \
	-v hadoop:/var/hadoop
	-v hadoop_logs:/var/log/hadoop
	--name hadoop hadoop:3.3.0
----

==== Volumes

The data resists in the `/var/hadoop` directory. You can map that directory to externalize it.

Similarly the `/var/log/hadoop` folder contains the log files.

The configuration files are located in the `/etc/hadoop` directory.
